# Dark One Dark Vim

Vim theme based in [mgovea Atom syntax theme](https://github.com/mgovea/dark-one-dark-syntax)


I pretend to port both UI and Syntax theme to Vim.

At this moment is a very very WIP project.


This started as I usually use Atom as text editor, but after a few trys definitely moved to Vim. The only one thing I missed was the UI and Syntax themes, therefore, I tried to port Dark One Dark using [Themer](themer.dev) but was missing a lot of things, so finally, using the base of Themer, I'm getting in to this mess.
